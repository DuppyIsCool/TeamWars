# TeamWars

TeamWars is a team based war plugin that encapsulates my Guilds plugin making each guild apart of teams.

## Description
This plugin is meant for a custom server I've worked for.

Each player will join a team that they contribute points to through the economy. 1 point = 1 in-game currency. 

Players can form Guilds to claim and Protect their land from enemies. Guilds have Upkeep based on their member count and land claimed(Formula can be changed through config). Guilds that fail their upkeep will have their land unclaimed and the guild disbanded. 

Guilds are barred by having too many members and land claim is based on that member count (can be changed). This project was not designed for stand-alone use. Members cannot contribute points via command due to the fact this plugin was designed to be used with CommandSigns in mind (or some other command execution plugin). 

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* Depends on Vault for economy/Guild Upkeep. Will Error and crash without it.


A permissions plugin, such as LuckPerms, is reccomended for managing the user permissions defined in the plugin.yml
## Help

/team help or /guild help will bring up the list of commands and their functions
